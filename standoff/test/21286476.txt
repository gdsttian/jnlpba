Stat6 is necessary and sufficient for IL-4's role in Th2 differentiation and cell expansion.
IL-4 plays a critical role in the differentiation of TCR-stimulated naive CD4 T cells to the Th2 phenotype. In response to IL-4, the IL-4R activates a set of phosphotyrosine binding domain-containing proteins, including insulin receptor substrate 1/2, Shc, and IL-4R interacting protein, as well as Stat6. Stat6 has been shown to be required for Th2 differentiation. To determine the roles of the phosphotyrosine binding adaptors in Th2 differentiation, we prepared a retrovirus containing a mutant of the human (h)IL-4R alpha-chain, Y497F, which is unable to recruit these adaptors. The mutant hIL-4Ralpha, as well as the wild-type (WT) hIL-4Ralpha, was introduced into naive CD4 T cells. Upon hIL-4 stimulation, Y497F worked as well as the WT hIL-4Ralpha in driving Th2 differentiation, as measured by Gata3 up-regulation and IL-4 production. Furthermore, IL-4-driven cell expansion was also normal in the cells infected with Y497F, although cells infected with Y497F were not capable of phosphorylating insulin receptor substrate 2. These results suggest that the signal pathway mediated by Y497 is dispensable for both IL-4-driven Th2 differentiation and cell expansion. Both WT and Y497F hIL-4Ralpha lose the ability to drive Th2 differentiation and cell expansion in Stat6-knockout CD4 T cells. A constitutively activated form of Stat6 introduced into CD4 T cells resulted in both Th2 differentiation and enhanced cell expansion. Thus, activated Stat6 is necessary and sufficient to mediate both IL-4-driven Th2 differentiation and cell expansion in CD4 T cells.
