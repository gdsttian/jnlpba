Expression of mammalian defensin genes.
Antimicrobial peptides are a prevalent mechanism of host defense found throughout nature. In mammals, defensins are among the most abundant of these broad-spectrum antibiotics, and are expressed in epithelial and hematopoietic cells. The defensin peptides are especially abundant in neutrophils; however, gene expression is limited to the promyelocyte stage. In epithelial cells, defensin genes are found as both constitutively expressed and inducible. Induction has been observed in vitro by stimulation with bacterial lipopolysaccharide as well as inflammatory mediators. In vivo, up-regulation of several defensin genes occurs in both infectious and inflammatory states. Gene regulation occurs via signal transduction pathways common to other innate immune responses, utilizing transcription factors such as nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB and NF interleukin-6. Together, the data suggest a broad-based innate host defense whereby potent antimicrobial peptides are present to prevent initial colonization by pathogenic microorganisms. In addition, the recognition of bacteria coupled with a nascent inflammatory response can bolster this defense by a coordinated up-regulation of the peptides.
