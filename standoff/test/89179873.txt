[Determination of the sensitivity to glucocorticoids in vitro].
A modified method for the determination of glucocorticoid receptors in human lymphocytes is suggested. The principal distinction of the method is standardization by the lymphocyte count in a sample (1 mln) and the labeled hormone concentration. The modification saves time and money, limits the range of the data variations, and makes use of a lesser volume of blood. Examinations of 70 children aged 4 to 15 suffering from the nephrotic form of glomerulonephritis have made it possible to distinguish two groups of patients: with relatively high values of specific binding X = 6820.1 +/- 530.0 (n = 30, p = 0.95, t = 2.04), this corresponding to a clinical form of hormone-sensitive glomerulonephritis, and with relatively low values of specific binding X = 1815.2 +/- 302.8 (n = 40, p = 0.95, t = 1.96), that corresponds to hormone-resistant glomerulonephritis. Dynamic studies have not shown any statistically significant changes in the specific binding values. These results permit regarding the specific binding value as a prognostic criterion in the assessment of corticosteroid therapy; this allows a wide employment of the described method in practical nephrology.
