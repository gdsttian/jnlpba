Glucocorticoid receptors and sensitivity in leukemias.
In an attempt to investigate the utility of glucocorticoid receptor determination to predict clinical responsiveness in human leukemias we have studied glucocorticoid receptors in the leukemic cells from 46 patients and in the lymphocytes from 18 normal donors. In the normal lymphocytes there were 3,875 (Median) specific binding sites per cell. The blasts from 17 patients with ANLL had on average higher levels of binding sites per cell (Median = 7,250, range: 0 to 15,295) than the other leukemias. Of the 15 patients with CLL, six had received glucocorticoid treatment for 3 to 5 years. Their lymphocytes had lower number of receptors (Median = 2,000) than the other cases which were newly diagnosed (Median = 4,500). Four patients had ALL/AUL, three patients had blast crisis as terminal phase of CML, and seven had leukemic Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (Median = 3,500 sites/cell). In 24 patients we have also studied the in vitro sensitivity of the leukemic cells to dexamethasone. There was no marked correlation between glucocorticoid receptor levels and in vitro sensitivity. An attempt to correlate receptor levels with clinical responsiveness demonstrated that glucocorticoid receptor determination might be of value in patients with lymphoid malignancies but probably not in patients with other leukemias.
