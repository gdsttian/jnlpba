Identification of a killer cell-specific regulatory element of the mouse perforin gene: an Ets-binding site-homologous motif that interacts with Ets-related proteins.
The gene encoding the cytolytic protein perforin is selectively expressed by activated killer lymphocytes. To understand the mechanisms underlying the cell-type-specific expression of this gene, we have characterized the regulatory functions and the DNA-protein interactions of the 5'-flanking region of the mouse perforin gene (Pfp). A region extending from residues +62 through -141, which possesses the essential promoter activity, and regions further upstream, which are able to either enhance or suppress gene expression, were identified. The region between residues -411 and -566 was chosen for further characterization, since it contains an enhancer-like activity. We have identified a 32-mer sequence (residues -491 to -522) which appeared to be capable of enhancing gene expression in a killer cell-specific manner. Within this segment, a 9-mer motif (5'-ACAGGAAGT-3', residues -505 to -497; designated NF-P motif), which is highly homologous to the Ets proto-oncoprotein-binding site, was found to interact with two proteins, NF-P1 and NF-P2. NF-P2 appears to be induced by reagents known to up-regulate the perforin message level and is present exclusively in killer cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and UV cross-linking experiments revealed that NF-P1 and NF-P2 may possess common DNA-binding subunits. However, the larger native molecular mass of NF-P1 suggests that NF-P1 contains an additional non-DNA-binding subunit(s). In view of the homology between the NF-P motif and other Ets proto-oncoprotein-binding sites, it is postulated that NF-P1 and NF-P2 belong to the Ets protein family. Results obtained from the binding competition assay, nevertheless, suggest that NF-P1 and NF-P2 are related to but distinct from Ets proteins, e.g., Ets-1, Ets-2, and NF-AT/Elf-1, known to be expressed in T cells.
