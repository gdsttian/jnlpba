Localized pancreatic NF-kappaB activation and inflammatory response in taurocholate-induced pancreatitis.
Transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) is activated in cerulein pancreatitis and mediates cytokine expression. The role of transcription factor activation in other models of pancreatitis has not been established. Here we report upregulation of NF-kappaB and inflammatory molecules, and their correlation with local pancreatic injury, in a model of severe pancreatitis. Rats received intraductal infusion of taurocholate or saline, and the pancreatic head and tail were analyzed separately. NF-kappaB and activator protein-1 (AP-1) activation were assessed by gel shift assay, and mRNA expression of interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, KC, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and inducible nitric oxide synthase was assessed by semiquantitative RT-PCR. Morphological damage and trypsin activation were much greater in the pancreatic head than tail, in parallel with a stronger activation of NF-kappaB and cytokine mRNA. Saline infusion mildly affected these parameters. AP-1 was strongly activated in both pancreatic segments after either taurocholate or saline infusion. NF-kappaB inhibition with N-acetylcysteine ameliorated the local inflammatory response. Correlation between localized NF-kappaB activation, cytokine upregulation, and tissue damage suggests a key role for NF-kappaB in the development of the inflammatory response of acute pancreatitis.
