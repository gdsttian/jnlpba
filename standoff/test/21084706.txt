Homocysteine stimulates the expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 in endothelial cells leading to enhanced monocyte chemotaxis.
Hyperhomocysteinemia has been identified as an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis. The infiltration of monocytes into the arterial wall is one of the key events during atherogenesis. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is a potent chemokine that stimulates the migration of monocytes into the intima of the arterial wall. The mechanism by which increased monocyte infiltration occurs in atherosclerotic lesions in patients with hyperhomocysteinemia has not been delineated. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of homocysteine on MCP-1 production in endothelial cells. Cells were incubated with homocysteine. The secretion of MCP-1 protein was significantly increased (195% as compared to the control) in cells treated with pathological concentrations of homocysteine. Such effect was accompanied by an increased expression of MCP-1 mRNA (176% as compared to the control) in endothelial cells which resulted in enhanced monocyte chemotaxis. The p38 MAP kinase as well as other members of the p38 MAP kinase pathway, including MKK3, MKK6, ATF-2 and Elk-1, were activated in homocysteine-treated cells. Homocysteine-induced MCP-1 expression and subsequent monocyte chemotaxis were blocked by a p38 MAP kinase inhibitor (SB203580) suggesting that the p38 MAP kinase pathway might be involved in homocysteine-induced MCP-1 expression in endothelial cells. In contrast, staurosporine, a protein kinase C inhibitor, had no effect on homocysteine-induced MCP-1 expression. In conclusion, our results indicate that homocysteine stimulates MCP-1 expression in endothelial cells leading to enhanced monocyte chemotaxis.
