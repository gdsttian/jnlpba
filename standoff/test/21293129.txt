Synergistic transcriptional activation of human Acyl-coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransterase-1 gene by interferon-gamma and all-trans-retinoic acid THP-1 cells.
Acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) is an intracellular enzyme involved in cellular cholesterol homeostasis and in atherosclerotic foam cell formation. Human ACAT-1 gene contains two promoters (P1 and P7), each located in a different chromosome (1 and 7) (Li, B. L., Li, X. L., Duan, Z. J., Lee, O., Lin, S., Ma, Z. M., Chang, C. C., Yang, X. Y., Park, J. P., Mohandas, T. K., Noll, W., Chan, L., and Chang, T. Y. (1999) J. Biol Chem. 274, 11060-11071). Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), a cytokine that exerts many pro-atherosclerotic effects in vivo, causes up-regulation of ACAT-1 mRNA in human blood monocyte-derived macrophages and macrophage-like cells but not in other cell types. To examine the molecular nature of this observation, we identified within the ACAT-1 P1 promoter a 159-base pair core region. This region contains 4 Sp1 elements and an IFN-gamma activated sequence (GAS) that overlaps with the second Sp1 element. In the monocytic cell line THP-1 cell, the combination of IFN-gamma and all-trans-retinoic acid (a known differentiation agent) enhances the ACAT-1 P1 promoter but not the P7 promoter. Additional experiments showed that all-trans-retinoic acid causes large induction of the transcription factor STAT1, while IFN-gamma causes activation of STAT1 such that it binds to the GAS/Sp1 site in the ACAT-1 P1 promoter. Our work provides a molecular mechanism to account for the effect of IFN-gamma in causing transcriptional activation of ACAT-1 in macrophage-like cells.
