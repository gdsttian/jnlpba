Inhibition of CD28/CD3-mediated costimulation of naive and memory human T lymphocytes by intracellular incorporation of polyclonal antibodies specific for the activator protein-1 transcriptional complex.
A number of indirect methods have been utilized in demonstrating activator protein-1 transcription factor function in IL-2 promoter activity. However, there has been no direct demonstration that activator protein-1 is involved in CD28-dependent costimulation of IL-2 gene transcription in freshly isolated naive and memory human T lymphocytes. To address this issue, the method of scrape loading was applied to purified peripheral blood T lymphocytes. Since scrape loading relies on adherent cells, peripheral blood human T (PB-T) cells were immobilized on the nonspecific cell attachment factor poly-L-lysine. Cells scraped off poly-L-lysine in the presence of Ig FITC efficiently incorporated Ig, with relatively uniform fluorescence. T cells retained their physical parameters as measured by forward and side light scatter, and functional activity as measured by costimulation of proliferation and IL-2 production after being scraped off this substrate. CD28/CD3-costimulated T cells produced intracellular IL-2 from all subsets measured (CD4+, CD4-, CD45RO+, and CD45RO-). IL-2 production and intracellular accumulation in nonscraped PB-T cells activated with CD28/CD3 coligation were skewed favoring CD45RO+ and CD4+ subsets, as was IL-2 production in scraped PB-T cells. The intracellular incorporation of Abs specific for c-Fos and c-Jun family members by scrape loading inhibited the production and intracellular accumulation of IL-2 within 6 h of costimulation with PMA/ionomycin, or costimulation by CD28 and CD3 ligation. Scrape loading thus provides an efficient mechanism for intracellular incorporation of macromolecules, and the first direct evidence that c-Fos and c-Jun are involved in transcription of the IL-2 gene within its correct chromosomal context, in resting human T lymphocyte subpopulations.
