In vitro-activated human lupus T cells express normal estrogen receptor proteins which bind to the estrogen response element.
We have shown that estrogen receptor (ERalpha, ERbeta) transcripts are expressed in SLE and normal T cells. In this study, T cell nuclear extracts from female lupus patients and normal donors were tested for biologically active ER proteins capable of binding to the human estrogen response element (hERE) by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. When peripheral blood T cells were stimulated with 17beta-estradiol (E2), PMA and ionomycin, two major retarded bands in T cell nuclear extracts exhibited a migration pattern similar to slow migrating protein-ERE complexes in human breast cancer cell extracts. T cells cultured only with E2 did not have these complexes. The formation of the complexes was inhibited by competition with the hERE cold oligonucleotide and partially with anti-ERalpha antibodies. There was no notable difference in the migration pattern of ERE-binding proteins between the SLE and normal T cell extracts. Together, these results suggest that activated human T cells, whether lupus-derived or normal-derived, contain biologically active ERalpha proteins. Other factors may be responsible for differential sensitivity of lupus T cells to estrogen.
