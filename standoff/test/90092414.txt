Number of glucocorticoid receptors in lymphocytes and their sensitivity to hormone action.
The study demonstrated a decreased level of glucocorticoid receptors (GR) in peripheral blood lymphocytes from hypercholesterolemic subjects, and an elevated level in patients with acute myocardial infarction. In the lymphocytes with a high GR number, dexamethasone inhibited [3H]-thymidine and [3H]-acetate incorporation into DNA and cholesterol, respectively, in the same manner as in the control cells. On the other hand, a decreased GR number resulted in a less efficient dexamethasone inhibition of the incorporation of labeled compounds. These data showed that the sensitivity of lymphocytes to glucocorticoids changed only with a decrease of GR level.
