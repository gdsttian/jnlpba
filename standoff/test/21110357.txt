The lack of NF-kappa B transactivation and PKC epsilon expression in CD4(+)CD8(+) thymocytes correlates with negative selection.
Deletion of autoreactive thymocytes at the DP stage is the basis for tolerance to thymus-expressed self antigens. In this study we investigated whether distinct signalling pathways are induced in DP thymocytes as compared to mature T cells upon stimulation with antigen. Using triple transgenic mice expressing a TCR transgene, dominant negative ras/Mek proteins and a reporter gene construct with AP-1 or NF-kappa B binding sites, we showed a complete lack of transcriptional activity of NF-kappa B but not AP-1 in DP thymocytes, whereas both were transcriptionally active in mature T cells after antigenic stimulation. Lack of NF-kappa B induction correlated with increased death in response to antigen. AP-1 induction was dependent on the integrity of the ras/Mek pathway indicating that this pathway was activated in the DP thymocytes. In contrast, we found a complete lack of constitutive expression of the epsilon isoform of Protein Kinase C (PKC) in DP thymocytes, although it was present in mature thymocytes and peripheral T cells. Taken together the results suggest that the lack of PKC epsilon in DP thymocytes could lead to the absence of NF-kappa B activity after antigenic stimulation contributing to negative selection.
