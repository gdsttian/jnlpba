CD28 and T cell co-stimulation.
Over the last decade the concept of T cell co-stimulation has emerged to take a central role in the process of T cell activation. However, the exact definition of co-stimulation is still unclear. In this review, we re-examine the concept of co-stimulation. We suggest that while co-stimulation is important, there is little evidence to link co-stimulation with T cell anergy. We then suggest a framework for studying co-stimulation. Focusing on recent advances in our understanding of CD28, we discuss four areas of T cell activation where co-stimulation may play a role.
