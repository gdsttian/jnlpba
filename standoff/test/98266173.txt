Overexpression of p65 and c-Jun substitutes for B7-1 costimulation by targeting the CD28RE within the IL-2 promoter.
The role of Rel and activation protein-1 (AP-1) in IL-2 promoter activity in B7-1- and leukocyte function-associated Ag-3 (LFA. 3)-costimulated T cells has been evaluated. We demonstrate that overexpression of c-Jun but not c-Fos increases IL-2 promoter activity in both B7-1- and LFA-3-costimulated Jurkat T cells. Cotransfection of both c-Jun and c-Fos substitutes for B7-1 costimulation in driving an activation protein-1 response element but not for the IL-2 promoter. Overexpression of Rel proteins demonstrated that p65-expressing Jurkat cells transcribed equally well a nuclear factor kappabeta reporter construct when costimulated with B7-1 or LFA-3, but transcription of IL-2 promoter or CD28 response element (CD28RE)-driven reporters was superior in B7-1-costimulated cells. Combined expression of c-Jun and p65 induced vigorous transcription of IL-2 promoter- and CD28RE-driven reporter constructs in both LFA-3- and B7-1-costimulated Jurkat cells. Mutating the CD28RE but not the upstream nuclear factor kappabeta-binding site in the IL-2 promoter reduced B7-1-driven transcription >90%. The results implicates a major role of the CD28RE in the integration of p65/c-Jun-mediated transcription within the IL-2 promoter. We suggest that the transition from an autocrine LFA-3-driven immune response to a B7--induced paracrine immune response involves the activation of c-Jun and p65, which target the CD28RE region of the IL-2 promoter.
