[Tumor histology and steroid receptors in breast carcinoma].
In Specimens of 115 patients with breast cancer 4 tumorparameters (tumorsize, tumorboder, nucleargrade, lymphocytic stromal reaction) 3 features of regional lymphnodes (sinushistiocytosis, T-cellreaction, lymphnode metastases) and estrogen and progesteron receptors were determined. A strong sinushistiocytosis and T-cellreaction could be verified mainly in metastases in free lymphnodes. The steroid receptor content does not correlate with histological parameters.
