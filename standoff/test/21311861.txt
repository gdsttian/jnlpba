Signal thresholds and modular synergy during expression of costimulatory molecules in B lymphocytes.
We analyzed intracellular pathways modulating surface densities of CD80 and CD86 in B cells activated through ligation of the Ag receptor, and the adhesion molecule CD54. Whereas B cell Ag receptor (BCR) cross-linking alone stimulated increased expression of CD86, up-regulation of CD80 required dual stimulation with anti-IgM and anti-CD54. The principal downstream component contributed by BCR signaling, toward both CD80 and CD86 induction, was the elevated concentration of free cytoplasmic Ca(2+), recruited by way of capacitative influx. This alone was sufficient to generate an increase in CD86 levels. However, CD80 enhancement required the concerted action of both intracellular Ca(2+) concentration and CD54-initiated pathways. The nexus between anti-IgM and anti-CD54 stimulation, in the context of CD80 regulation, was identified to involve a self-propagating process of sequential synergy. The first step involved amplified accumulation of intracellular cAMP, as a result of cross-talk between BCR-mobilized Ca(2+) and CD54-derived signals. This then facilitated a second synergistic interaction between Ca(2+) and cAMP, culminating in CD80 expression. Our findings of distinct signal transducer requirements, with the added consequences of cross-talk, offers an explanation for variable modulation of costimulatory molecule expression in response to diverse physiological stimuli. Importantly, these results also reveal how concentration threshold barriers for recruitment of individual second messengers can be overcome by constructive convergence of signaling modules.
