NF kappa b signaling in posthypoxic endothelial cells: relevance to E-selectin expression and neutrophil adhesion.
Our previous studies have implicated the nuclear transcription factor kappa B (NF kappa B) in the regulation of adhesion molecule expression in endothelial cells exposed to anoxia-reoxygenation (A/R) or a redox imbalance. The objectives of this study were (1) to define the kinetics of NF kappa B activation by examining I kappa B alpha degradation and the nuclear translocation of p65 in response to A/R or redox imbalance (induced by treatment of cells with diamide and buthionine sulfoximine) and (2) to determine whether the signal for I kappa B alpha degradation, nuclear translocation of p65, and E-selectin-mediated neutrophil adhesion is related to the activity of protein tyrosine kinase (PTK), protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) and/or protein kinase C (PKC). The results demonstrate that both A/R and redox imbalance led to I kappa B alpha degradation within 30 min and the concomitant appearance of p65 in the nucleus, consistent with rapid cytosolic activation of NF kappa B and subsequent nuclear translocation of the activated p65 subunit. Inhibition of PKC blocked I kappa B alpha degradation and p65 translocation in A/R-challenged, but not redox-altered, endothelial cells. However, both A/R- and redox-induced NF kappa B activation was blocked by inhibition of PTK. Similarly, A/R-induced E-selectin expression and neutrophil-endothelial cell adhesion were blocked by inhibition of PKC or PTK, while only PTK inhibited the redox-induced adhesion response. Pretreatment of cells with N-acetyl cysteine effectively blocked A/R- or redox-induced I kappa B degradation and significantly attenuated the respective neutrophil adhesion responses. Collectively, these findings indicate that A/R-induced E-selectin expression and neutrophil-endothelial cell adhesion are mediated by both PKC and PTK, which signal rapid activation of NF kappa B. This A/R-induced NF kappa B signaling response appears to be mediated, at least in part, by intracellular redox imbalance. Copyright 2001 S. Karger AG, Basel.
