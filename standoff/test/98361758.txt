Synergistic activation of MAP kinase (ERK1/2) by erythropoietin and stem cell factor is essential for expanded erythropoiesis.
Stem cell factor (SCF) and erythropoietin (EPO) work synergistically to support erythropoiesis, but the mechanism for this synergism is unknown. By using purified human erythroid colony-forming cells (ECFC), we have found that SCF and EPO synergistically activate MAP kinase (MAPK, ERK1/2), which correlates with the cell growth and thus may be responsible for the synergistic effects. Treatment of the cells with PD98059 and wortmannin, inhibitors of MEK and PI-3 kinase, respectively, inhibited the synergistic activation of MAPK and also the cell growth, further supporting this conclusion. Wortmannin only inhibits MAPK activation induced by EPO but not that by SCF, suggesting that SCF and EPO may activate MAPK through different pathways, which would facilitate synergy. Furthermore, EPO, but not SCF, led to activation of STAT5, whereas SCF and wortmannin had no effect on the EPO-induced STAT5 activation, suggesting that STAT5 is not involved in the synergistic action of SCF and EPO. Together, the data suggest that synergistic activation of MAPK by SCF and EPO is essential for expanded erythropoiesis. Copyright 1998 by The American Society of Hematology.
