Chronic lymphatic leukaemia: cellular effects of glucocorticoids in vitro.
Glucocorticoid receptor levels and steroid induced inhibition of nucleic acid precursors have been examined in lymphocytes from 27 patients at different stages of chronic lymphatic leukaemia. No correlation can be found between the level of glucocorticoid receptors and the stage of the disease. On the other hand, a significant difference (P less than 0.02) was found between stage O and stage III/IV patients, in terms of the in vitro effect of dexamethasone on [3H] uridine incorporation.
