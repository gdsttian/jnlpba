Expression of SART3 antigen and induction of CTLs by SART3-derived peptides in breast cancer patients.
We recently reported the SART3 tumour-rejection antigen as possessing tumour epitopes capable of inducing HLA-class I-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). This study investigated expression of the SART3 antigen in breast cancer to explore an appropriate molecule for use in specific immunotherapy of breast cancer patients. The SART3 antigen was detected in all of the breast cancer cell lines tested, 30 of 40 (75%) breast cancer tissue samples, and 0 of 3 non-tumourous breast tissue samples. SART3 derived peptides at positions 109-118 and 315-323 induced HLA-A24 restricted CTLs that reacted to breast cancer cells from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of breast cancer patients. Therefore, the SART3 antigen and its peptides could be an appropriate molecule for use in specific immunotherapy of the majority of HLA-A24-positive breast cancer patients.
