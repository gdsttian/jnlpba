[Preliminary observation of level free-form E receptor levels in serum of normal childbearing-aged and pregnant women].
In 137 cases of childbearing-aged and pregnant women, free form E receptor levels (sE) in serum were measured by ELISA. The level of sE was significantly decreased during the first trimester, slightly higher in the second trimester, and recovered to normal in the third trimester. The level remained lower in 29 PIH women but appeared higher in overdue pregnancies as compared with the normal 3rd trimester range. The results indicate that there is a relationship between a change in T cell function and pregnancy.
