Functional uncoupling of the Janus kinase 3-Stat5 pathway in malignant growth of human T cell leukemia virus type 1-transformed human T cells.
Human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) transforms cytokine-dependent T lymphocytes and causes adult T cell leukemia. Janus tyrosine kinase (Jak)3 and transcription factors Stat5a and Stat5b are essential for the proliferation of normal T cells and are constitutively hyperactivated in both HTLV-1-transformed human T cell lines and lymphocytes isolated from HTLV-1-infected patients; therefore, a critical role for the Jak3-Stat5 pathway in the progression of this disease has been postulated. We recently reported that tyrphostin AG-490 selectively blocked IL-2 activation of Jak3/Stat5 and growth of murine T cell lines. Here we demonstrate that disruption of Jak3/Stat5a/b signaling with AG-490 (50 &mgr;M) blocked the proliferation of primary human T lymphocytes, but paradoxically failed to inhibit the proliferation of HTLV-1-transformed human T cell lines, HuT-102 and MT-2. Structural homologues of AG-490 also inhibited the proliferation of primary human T cells, but not HTLV-1-infected cells. Disruption of constitutive Jak3/Stat5 activation by AG-490 was demonstrated by inhibition of 1) tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak3, Stat5a (Tyr(694)), and Stat5b (Tyr(699)); 2) serine phosphorylation of Stat5a (Ser(726)) as determined by a novel phosphospecific Ab; and 3) Stat5a/b DNA binding to the Stat5-responsive beta-casein promoter. In contrast, AG-490 had no effect on DNA binding by p50/p65 components of NF-kappaB, a transcription factor activated by the HTLV-1-encoded phosphoprotein, Tax. Collectively, these data suggest that the Jak3-Stat5 pathway in HTLV-1-transformed T cells has become functionally redundant for proliferation. Reversal of this functional uncoupling may be required before Jak3/Stat5 inhibitors will be useful in the treatment of this malignancy.
