Glucocorticoid receptors and in vitro corticosensitivity of peanut-positive and peanut-negative human thymocyte subpopulations.
In 6 human thymus glands, the immature subset of thymocytes was separated from the more mature one, by differential peanut lectin agglutination. These 2 cell subpopulations were analyzed for glucocorticoid receptor content by using a whole cell assay, with (3H)-triamcinolone acetonide as tracer. The unagglutinated thymocytes (peanut negative) contained about 2 times more receptor sites per cell than agglutinated (peanut positive) ones (7650 +/- 1550 S.D. verus 3195 +/- 896 S.D.). The affinity for steroid was similar in both cell subsets, as was the stereospecificity for glucocorticoids, the time-course of steroid-receptor association, and cytoplasmic to nuclear translocation. Despite the greater number of glucocorticoid receptor sites, the peanut-negative thymocyte subpopulation did not differ from the peanut-positive one in its sensitivity to the inhibitory effects of triamcinolone acetonide, as determined by measurements of the incorporation of radiolabeled precursors of protein and DNA. Moreover, the peanut-negative subset appeared more resistant in vitro to the steroid-induced cell lysis as compared to the peanut-positive one. Thus, our data suggest that glucocorticoid receptor density and corticosensitivity are not directly correlated and that the number of glucocorticoid receptor sites may be dependent on the degree of immunologic maturation.
