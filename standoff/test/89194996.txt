Association of increased lytic effector cell function with high estrogen receptor levels in tumor-bearing patients with breast cancer.
Tumor-bearing patients with breast cancer were assayed for their natural killer (NK) cell activity and for the function of activated cytotoxic T-cells, as assessed by lectin-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (LDCC). Tumor-bearing patients with breast cancer had a significant increase in NK activity and in LDCC, as compared with healthy control individuals. Although the enhanced NK cell activity and LDCC were closely associated with high levels (greater than 31 fmol/mg) of estrogen receptor (ER) content in the primary tumor, no other clinical or histologic correlation between the increase in either parameter of cytotoxic effector cell function could be found. Thus, ER levels greater than 31 fmol/mg might be associated with increased cytotoxic effector cell function in tumor-bearing patients with breast cancer.
