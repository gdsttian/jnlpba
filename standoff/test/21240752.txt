Pax5 determines the identity of B cells from the beginning to the end of B-lymphopoiesis.
Despite being one of the most intensively studied cell types, the molecular basis of B cell specification is largely unknown. The Pax5 gene encoding the transcription factor BSAP is required for progression of B-lymphopoiesis beyond the pro-B cell stage. Pax5-deficient pro-B cells are, however, not yet committed to the B-lymphoid lineage, but instead have a broad lymphomyeloid developmental potential. Pax5 appears to mediate B-lineage commitment by repressing the transcription of non-B-lymphoid genes and by simultaneously activating the expression of B-lineage-specific genes. Pax5 thus functions both as a transcriptional repressor and activator, depending on its interactions with corepressors of the Groucho protein family or with positive regulators such as the TATA-binding protein. Once committed to the B-lineage, B cells require Pax5 function to maintain their B-lymphoid identity throughout B cell development.
