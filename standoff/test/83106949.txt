Reduced level of cellular glucocorticoid receptors in patients with anorexia nervosa.
Specific glucocorticoid receptors were measured in circulating mononuclear leukocytes from 12 patients with anorexia nervosa and 21 healthy control subjects. Cells from patients were found to contain a significantly (p less than 0.01) lower level of glucocorticoid receptor (3830 +/- 210 sites/cell, mean +/- SE) than those from controls (4930 +/- 250 sites/cell). A partial glucocorticoid receptor defect may well explain the abnormal cortisol metabolism and glucocorticoid resistance commonly found in patients with anorexia nervosa.
