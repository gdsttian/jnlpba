Correlation of steroid receptors with histologic differentiation in mammary carcinoma. A Singapore experience.
Cancer of the breast is the most common tumor in females in Singapore, with the rate of 20.7 per 100,000 per year (1977 estimate), which is predicted to increase to 29.8 per 100,000 women per year by 1995. A detailed histopathologic review of 50 primary breast cancer tumors analyzed for estrogen receptor (ER) level was carried out and a variety of morphologic features correlated with ER results to identify any factors that will improve the management and prognosis for breast cancer. Cytosol was incubated with 3H-estradiol in the presence and absence of cold diethylstilbestrol, and bound and free hormone were separated by Dextran-coated charcoal method. Tumors binding more than 5 fmol/mg cytosol protein were classified as ER-positive. Progesterone receptor (PR) level was analyzed in some specimens with the use of a similar method. Most of the patients were Chinese (90%). Three patients were Malays, one was Indian, and one was European in this series. Results indicated that there was strong correlation between ER level, age, and histologic grade of the tumors. No correlation existed between absence or presence of lymph node metastases and ER. Although there was a trend for ER-positive tumors to have a low-grade lymphocytic infiltration, the difference was not statistically significant.
