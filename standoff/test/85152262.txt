Acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children: current status, controversies, and future perspective.
Disease-free survival (DFS) in childhood ALL is 60%, and survival in good, average, and poor prognostic groups defined by initial WBC and age is 90, 60, and 45%, respectively. Additional immunological, morphological, biochemical, cytokinetic, and cytogenetic factors have been identified, illustrating the heterogeneity of ALL and its derivation from malignant clones at various stages of differentiation and with varying rates of proliferation. Of biologic importance, these factors may refine further the characteristic features of clinically-determined prognostic groups. Multivariate analysis of large prospective trials with homogeneous therapy will be required to determine the independent prognostic importance of these factors. Current treatment strategies in ALL include (1) tailoring therapy and its intensity to prognostic groups; (2) multiple-drug combinations in induction; (3) early use of intrathecal (IT) methotrexate (MTX); (4) CNS prophylaxis with IT MTX alone in good prognosis patients and combined cranial radiation (CXRT), 1800 rads plus IT MTX, in average and poor prognosis patients. Current studies show a CNS relapse rate of 5% in all prognostic groups. Late neuropsychological defects caused by cranial XRT and IT MTX have prompted programs designed to reduce the potential late toxicity of CNS prophylaxis. More pronounced in younger children, these abnormalities include decreased IQ, visual-motor incoordination, poor performance in mathematics, and memory dysfunction. Until 1980, more intensive induction, consolidation, and maintenance therapy had failed to prolong DFS in children with a poor prognosis. In West Germany (Berlin-Frankfurt-Muenster protocol) a 70 to 75% DFS is seen in all patients regardless of initial WBC, suggesting that effective therapy will override prognostic factors. Ultra-high-dose MTX, without cranial radiation, is also showing promise in poor prognosis patients. Other issues include the optimal duration of therapy, the role of testicular biopsies, and prophylactic testicular radiation. Recent studies suggest that prognostic factors lose their significance after 2 years of continuous complete remission and that 2 years of maintenance therapy is adequate. Bilateral open-wedge testicular biopsies have identified occult testicular disease in 8 to 10% of males. A unified approach to children with leukemia/lymphoma, a group with a particularly poor prognosis, utilizing NHL-type therapy may be more effective than conventional ALL therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
