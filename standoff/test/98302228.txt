Long-range transcriptional regulation of cytokine gene expression.
Most studies on the control of cytokine gene expression have involved the functional analysis of proximal promoters. Recent work has identified distal elements that mediate long-range cytokine gene regulation and has implicated chromatin reorganization in regulation of cytokine gene loci. These studies have begun to elucidate the basis for cell-specificity and high-level expression of cytokine genes.
