Differences in expression of transcription factor AP-1 in human promyelocytic HL-60 cells during differentiation towards macrophages versus granulocytes.
Commitment of HL-60 cells to macrophage or granulocytic differentiation was achieved by incubation with 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) for 30-60 min or with dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) for 24 h respectively. The commitment stage towards PMA-induced macrophage differentiation was associated with increases in jun B and c-fos mRNA levels, as well as with an increase in the binding activity of transcription factor AP-1. Nevertheless, gel retardation analysis indicated that the AP-1 activity detected in untreated cells was drastically reduced during the commitment stage of DMSO-induced HL-60 differentiation towards granulocytes. When HL-60 cells were treated with sodium butyrate, which induced monocytic differentiation, a remarkable increase in AP-1 binding activity was detected. Treatment of HL-60 cells with 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, another monocytic differentiation agent, induced a weak, but appreciable, increase in AP-1 activity. Furthermore, addition of sodium butyrate or 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 to HL-60 cells induced the expression of c-fos, c-jun, jun B and jun D proto-oncogenes. In contrast, when HL-60 cells were treated with retinoic acid, a granulocytic differentiation inducer, no enhanced AP-1 binding activity was observed, and only a weak increase in jun D mRNA level was detected. These data indicate that formation of AP-1 is not required for the induction of HL-60 differentiation towards granulocytes, whereas induction of monocytic differentiation is correlated with an increase in AP-1 activity. The differential expression of AP-1 activity may be critical in the differentiation of HL-60 cells towards monocytic or granulocytic lineages.
