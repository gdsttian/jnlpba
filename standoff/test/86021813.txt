Glucocorticoid receptors of mononuclear leukocytes from myasthenia gravis patients.
The present study was performed to analyse glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binding in peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes (MNL) from 39 myasthenia gravis (MG) patients (unoperated patients (n = 13), thymectomized patients (n = 14) and patients receiving glucocorticoids: thymectomized (n = 11) and unoperated (n = 6]. A whole cell binding assay with 3(H) dexamethasone was used. GR mean values were significantly higher in the MNL of MG patients (thymectomized or not) not receiving glucocorticoid than in the MNL of healthy donors. Affinity was within the normal range. Sex, age or clinical forms of illness did not influence the results. In patients receiving prednisone (Pd) the GR values were significantly lower than in MG patients without Pd therapy, independent of Pd dose or time of administration. No differences in receptor binding between normal subjects and MG patients receiving Pd have been found.
