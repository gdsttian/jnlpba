Effects of IL-4 and Fc gamma receptor II engagement on Egr-1 expression during stimulation of B lymphocytes by membrane immunoglobulin crosslinking.
Egr-1 is an immediate early gene that is rapidly upregulated in response to mitogenic signals induced by antigen receptor crosslinking on murine B lymphocytes. It has been shown that levels of Egr-1 expression are closely correlated with B cell proliferation in several models of B cell activation and tolerance. We compared the expression of Egr-1 during B cell stimulation with Fab'2 and IgG anti-immunoglobulin (anti-Ig), since it is known that Fab'2 anti-Ig is mitogenic while IgG anti-Ig is not, owing to a dominant inhibitory effect of crosslinking the B cell Fc gamma RII to membrane Ig. While mitogenic doses of Fab'2 anti-Ig induce large and rapid increases in Egr-1 expression, IgG anti-Ig results in smaller increases in Egr-1 mRNA, comparable to that seen with submitogenic concentrations of Fab'2 anti-Ig. However, the correlation between Egr-1 expression and B cell proliferation breaks down when IL-4 is added as a co-mitogen to induce B cell proliferation with IgG anti-Ig or submitogenic concentrations of Fab'2 anti-Ig. No corresponding increases in Egr-1 mRNA levels are observed when IL-4 is added. Therefore, IL-4 overcomes Fc receptor-mediated inhibition of B cell proliferation without affecting inhibition of Egr-1 mRNA induction, as demonstrated earlier for c-myc mRNA in this system.
