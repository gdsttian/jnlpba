Cell cycle-related changes in number of T-lymphocyte receptors for glucocorticoids and insulin.
Enriched human peripheral T-lymphocytes were stimulated with PHA and examined for variations in insulin and glucocorticoid (dexamethasone) receptor numbers during the early phases of the cell cycle. Cells in G0, G1a and G1b phases, where the G1a - G1b transition is an Interleukin 2 dependent event, were quantitated by flow cytometry. Few but significant numbers of glucocorticoid receptors (2700/cell) and no insulin receptors (-1/cell) were found in the resting (G0) phase. As cells entered the G1a phase the specific binding of dexamethasone increased and of insulin took place. Although the specific binding further increased as T-cells entered the G1b phase (as measured at 44 h of incubation and using hydroxyurea-treated cells), the major changes in the specific binding of dexamethasone took place during the period 16 - 20 h after stimulation. Based on these findings, it is concluded that both receptor types (cell membrane and cytoplasmic receptors) are being formed and increased at G1 phase prior to cell proliferation, indicating the importance of G1 phase in immunoregulation.
