Granulocytes in the endometrium of post-partum women.
Endometrial samples of women at various stages of gonadal activity after parturition were examined for the presence and numbers of endometrial granulocytes. Although samples at all the stages contained significant numbers of the granulocytes (i.e. greater than 7/high-power field), the 100% values for late-proliferative and adaptation hyperplasia were significantly higher than the values for the resting (81.8%), early (82.4%) and mid- (87.9%) proliferative and secretory (83.3%) phases. We suggest that this correlates with the suggestion that the granulocytes constitute a receptor system for oestrogens.
