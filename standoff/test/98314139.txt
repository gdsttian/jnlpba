Elevated expression of differentiation inhibitory factor nm23 mRNA in monoblastic crisis of a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia.
Differentiation inhibitory factor nm23 gene has been found to be expressed in high quantities in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), especially in acute monocytic leukemia (AML-M5) and is suggested as a new prognostic factor in AML-M5. We report an example of elevated expression of nm23 mRNA in a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) who developed monoblastic crisis. Relative levels of nm23-H1 and -H2 mRNA extracted from the patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells and bone marrow mononuclear cells were measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The level of nm23-H1 mRNA in CML cells at the chronic phase was as high as that in bone marrow cells from healthy volunteers. The mRNA level of nm23-H2 was slightly below the normal level. At blastic crisis, however, expression of both nm23-H1 and -H2 mRNA was elevated to about three to nine times of that at the chronic phase. Proliferated blastic cells were positive for non-specific esterase, and the serum lysozyme level was elevated and diagnosed as monoblastic crisis. The patient received combined chemotherapy but response was partial. These findings are compatible with our previous report that nm23 gene is overexpressed in monocytic leukemia.
