Decreased expression of c-myc family genes in thymuses from myasthenia gravis patients.
The thymus is a critical organ for the elimination of autoreactive T cells by apoptosis. We studied the expression of apoptosis-associated genes, bcl-xL, bad, caspase-3, and c-myc family genes in myasthenia gravis (MG) thymuses. We observed that the mRNA levels of myc family genes, c-myc and max, were markedly reduced in MG thymuses. These results indicate that c-myc-mediated signaling is abnormal in MG thymuses. The levels of molecules whose expressions are associated with myc, such as STAM, prothymosin-alpha, and NFkappaB
