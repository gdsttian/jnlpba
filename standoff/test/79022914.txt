Clinical implications of glucocorticoid receptors in human leukemia.
Glucorticoid receptors were studied in various populations of normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes and leukemic lymphoblasts. Normal lymphocytes contain low levels of glucocorticoid receptor (approximately 2,500 sites/cell) which are identical in T- and non-T-fractions. Phytohemagglutinin treatment increases levels about 3-fold. Leukemic lymphoblasts contain larger numbers of receptor sites. Presence of receptor is correlated with in vitro sensitivitiy to glucocorticoids and in vivo response to therapy. Quantity of receptor is also correlated with complete remission duration independently of leukemic cell type (T or null), initial WBC, or age of patient. Quantitative determination of glucocorticoid receptor levels in acute lymphoblastic leukemia may be of value both as an independent prognostic variable and in suggesting which patients should receive glucocorticoid therapy.
