Tumor and serum beta-2-microglobulin expression in women with breast cancer.
To investigate whether the tumor expression of beta-2-microglobulin (beta 2-M) could serve as a marker of tumor biologic behavior, the authors studied specimens of breast carcinomas from 60 consecutive female patients. Presence of beta 2-M was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. No significant correlations were found between tumor beta 2-M expression and several histologic attributes such as type, histologic and nuclear grades, mitotic index, necrosis, vascular invasion, and lymphocytic infiltration. Likewise, beta 2-M was not associated with markers of disease extension such as TNM, (UICC, classification of malignant tumors) staging and axillary lymph node involvement or with estrogen, progesterone, and glucocorticoid receptor levels. However, there was a significantly positive association between tumor beta 2-M expression and the degree of lymphocytic infiltration in the tumor tissue. Beta 2-M serum levels were determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in samples from 22 of the above women. Although some of the highest values had been obtained in women with larger (T4) primary tumors, the authors failed to detect any statistical relationship between beta 2-M expression in the tumor with serum levels or between serum beta 2-M and the above histologic, laboratory, and clinical factors.
