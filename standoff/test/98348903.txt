Epidemiology and pathogenesis of AIDS-related lymphomas.
Among patients with congenital and acquired immunodeficiencies, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHLs ) are the most common tumors of the immune system. In the setting of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, as many as 10% to 20% of people ultimately developed NHLs. These tumors are clinically aggressive, frequently involve extranodal sites, and often exhibit unique features that distinguish them from NHL arising in individuals with other forms of immunosuppression. Important in the development of HIV-associated NHL are cytokines and other factors that induce B-cell proliferation and increase the likelihood of mutations of c-myc, bcl-6, and other tumor-suppressor genes with carcinogenic potential. Specific forms of HIV-associated NHL are linked to expression of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-latent proteins; the newly described DNA virus, Karposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus/human herpesvirus-8 (KSHV/HHV-8); and perhaps HIV. Elucidation of the factors that contribute to the high incidence of NHL among patients infected with HIV provides insights into important elements of lymphomagenesis.
