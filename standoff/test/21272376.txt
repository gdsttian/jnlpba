STAT3 is constitutively active in some patients with Polycythemia rubra vera.
OBJECTIVE:
Polycythemia vera is a clonal stem cell disorder characterized by hyperproliferation of the erythroid, myeloid, and megakaryocytic lineages. While it has been shown that progenitor cells of P. vera patients are hypersensitive to several growth factors including erythropoietin, insulin-like growth factor-1, thrombopoietin, interleukin-3, and granulocyte/monocyte colony-stimulating factor, the molecular pathogenesis of this disease remains unknown. Growth factor hypersensitivity could be mediated by changes in signal transduction pathways. We therefore investigated a common downstream effector of cytokines, the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). A constitutive activation of STAT factors could explain the increased proliferation of P. vera cells even in the absence of growth factor stimulation.
METHODS:
Peripheral granulocytes from patients with P. vera and from healthy volunteers were assayed for STAT1, 3, and 5 DNA binding by electrophoretic mobility shift assay.
RESULTS:
Four of 14 P. vera patients analyzed showed constitutive STAT3 DNA binding in unstimulated peripheral granulocytes, while none of the 17 healthy volunteers tested did. None of the subjects showed constitutive STAT1 or STAT5 activity. Western blotting demonstrated that, in the three patients, STAT3 is constitutively phosphorylated on Tyr 705, whereas it is unphosphorylated in the other patients and in controls. Interestingly, constitutive STAT3 activity did not correlate with the duration of disease or the treatment regimen. It was observed in a recently diagnosed patient and in two patients treated only with phlebotomy.
CONCLUSION:
Our data suggest that constitutive phosphorylation and activation of STAT3 is not a secondary event induced by mutagenizing agents or by prolonged hyperproliferation of hematopoietic cells, but rather represents a primary molecular aberration. Constitutively active STAT3 may contribute to the growth factor hypersensitivity of P. vera cells.
