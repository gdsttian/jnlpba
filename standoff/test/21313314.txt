Adipophilin is a sensitive marker for lipid loading in human blood monocytes.
Adipophilin, a marker of lipid accumulation initially described in adipocytes, was recently shown to be induced in macrophage foam cells. We found that even freshly isolated blood monocytes express adipophilin and that the amount of adipophilin protein is variable in monocytes from different healthy individuals. However, the physiological expression of adipophilin does not correlate with the levels of free fatty acids, cholesterylesters or free cholesterol. Enzymatically modified low-density lipoprotein (E-LDL) induces rapid foam cell formation in monocytes and upregulates adipophilin mRNA and protein within 2 h of incubation. This rapid induction of adipophilin is accompanied by a significant increase of free fatty acids in monocytes incubated with E-LDL. Adipophilin facilitates the uptake of free fatty acids, and here we demonstrate that free fatty acids increase is related to the early upregulation of adipophilin expression in blood monocytes. Fatty acids are ligands for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma), and the upregulation of adipophilin mRNA by PPARgamma agonists like 15d-PGJ(2) and ciglitazone indicates that PPARgamma may mediate the induction of adipophilin expression in human blood monocytes.
