Specific high-affinity receptors for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells: presence in monocytes and induction in T lymphocytes following activation.
Human peripheral blood monocytes have high affinity binding sites for 1,25-(OH)2D3 (Kd 0.14 nM, sedimentation coefficient 3.7S). Resting human peripheral blood T lymphocytes, however, do not have a demonstrable 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor. After activation with phytohemagglutinin the T cells exhibit the receptor within 24 h, and this expression is blocked by cycloheximide. The receptor in activated T lymphocytes has a sedimentation coefficient of 3.7S and a high affinity (Kd 0.10 nM) for the ligand.
