Heterogeneity of the in vitro responses to glucocorticoids in acute leukemia.
In leukocyte population freshly isolated from the blood of 26 patients with acute leukemia, we have measured several parameters including glucocorticoid receptors, nucleoside incorporation, percentage of cells in S phase, and steroid-induced cell lysis. In addition, in some cases, the short-term response to steroid therapy was determined. Although, in all the patients studied, leukocytes were found to contain glucocorticoid receptors, we failed to demonstrate any correlation between the level of binding sites and the in vitro or in vivo response to glucocorticoids. This absence of correlation could be in part explained by the marked heterogeneity of the steroid response demonstrated in leukocyte subpopulations. It appears, however, that the degree of steroid action in vitro as well as the extent of spontaneous and dexamethasone-induced cell death may be related to the number of cells in the S phase of the cell cycle.
