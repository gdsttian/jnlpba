[Glucocorticoid receptors in normal human lymphocytes].
Glucocorticoid (GC) receptors were studied in intact lymphocytes from 11 donors. GC binding parameters were found to be highly reproducible in repeated experiments with lymphocytes. It was shown that GC receptors in donors' lymphocytes could be distributed into two different classes similarly to the pattern seen in skin fibroblasts. Human lymphocytes are an adequate object for studying genetically determined variability of GC receptors and its clinical importance.
