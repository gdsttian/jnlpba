The role of NF-kappa B1 (p50/p105) gene expression in activation of human blood T-lymphocytes via CD2 and CD28 adhesion molecules.
Stimulation of primary human T-lymphocytes via CD2 and CD28 adhesion molecules induces a long-lasting proliferation (> 3 weeks). This potent activation does not require accessory cells, such as monocytes, but depends on persistent interleukin 2 (IL-2) secretion and receptivity, which is associated with high and prolonged expression of the inducible CD25/IL-2 receptor alpha (IL-2R alpha) chain gene. The transcription factor NF-kappa B participates in the regulation of both IL-2 and IL-2R alpha genes, as well as multiple cellular genes involved in T-cell proliferation. To evaluate the role of NF-kappa B in human peripheral blood T-lymphocytes, we previously analyzed the activation of NF-kappa B-related complexes in response to CD2+CD28 costimulation. We demonstrated a long-term induction of p50/p65 heterodimer, a putative p65/c-Rel heterodimer, and a constitutive nuclear expression of KBF1/p50 homodimers. As the role of p50 remains unclear, we focused our present study on NF-kappa B1 (p50/p105) gene regulation. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays and Western and Northern blot analyses, we studied NF-kappa B1 gene expression during T-cell stimulation via CD2+CD28. We observed a transient 4- to 5-fold increase of NF-kappa B1 gene expression at both the mRNA and protein levels, lasting for at least 24 h. p50 DNA-binding activity apparently stays highly controlled when p105 expression is enhanced by a physiological stimulus of peripheral blood T-cells. Partial inhibition of p50 and p105 expression by NF-kappa B1 antisense oligonucleotides significantly reduced T-cell proliferation and CD25/IL-2R alpha cell surface expression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
