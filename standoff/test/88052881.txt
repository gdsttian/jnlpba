Identification and purification of a human lymphoid-specific octamer-binding protein (OTF-2) that activates transcription of an immunoglobulin promoter in vitro.
The octamer sequence 5'-ATGCAAAT, in either orientation, serves as an upstream element in a variety of promoters and also occurs as a modular enhancer element. It is of particular interest in immunoglobulin genes since it is found in the upstream regions of all heavy and light chain promoters and in the heavy chain enhancer, both of which are known to be necessary for cell-specific expression. We report here the chromatographic separation of ubiquitous and B cell-specific octamer-binding proteins. The B cell factor was purified to homogeneity using affinity chromatography and consists of three peptides of 62, 61, and 58.5 +/- 1.5 kd. Each of the polypeptides was renatured after SDS-PAGE and shown to bind to the octamer sequence. The specific DNA binding activity of the pure B cell-specific factor was indistinguishable from that of the affinity-purified ubiquitous factor. This B cell-specific octamer-binding factor, in pure form, activated transcription from a kappa light chain promoter in vitro, thus demonstrating that it is indeed a B cell-specific transcription factor for this gene. In addition to the ubiquitous and B cell-specific octamer-binding factors, we identified several additional proteins, one of which is B cell-specific, that interact with the kappa promoter.
