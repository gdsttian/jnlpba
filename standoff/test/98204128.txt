Transcription factors that regulate monocyte/macrophage differentiation.
Although all the cells in an organism contain the same genetic information, differences in the cell phenotype arise from the expression of lineage-specific genes. During myelopoiesis, external differentiating signals regulate the expression of a set of transcription factors. The combined action of these transcription factors subsequently determines the expression of myeloid-specific genes and the generation of monocytes and macrophages. In particular, the transcription factor PU.1 has a critical role in this process. We review the contribution of several transcription factors to the control of macrophage development.
