Existence of retinoic acid-receptor-independent retinoid X-receptor-dependent pathway in myeloid cell function.
We previously reported that ER-27191 (4-[4,5,7,8,9,10-hexahydro-7,7,10,10-tetramethyl-1-(3-pyridylmethyl)anthra[1,2-b]pyrrol-3-yl]benzoic acid) is a potent antagonist of retinoic acid receptor (RAR), and ER-35795 ((2E,4E,6E)-7-[1-(1-methylethyl)-8-chloro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolin-6-yl]-6-fluoro-3-methyl-2,4,6-nonatrienoic acid) is a novel retinoid X receptor (RXR)-specific agonist. By using these compounds, we investigated whether distinct RAR-dependent and RXR-dependent pathways operate to mediate the diverse activities of retinoids, particularly, the effects of the RXR pathway on cellular function. ER-27191 completely antagonized HL60 cell differentiation induced by all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA). However, the differentiation induced by the ER-35795 was not antagonized at all by the RAR antagonist, but was inhibited by an RXR homodimer antagonist (LGD100754, (2E,4E,6Z)-7-(3-n-propoxy-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,5,8,8-tetramethylnaphthalen-2-yl)-3-methylocta-2,4,6-trienoic acid). Its agonistic action on RXR/RAR heterodimer, on the other hand, was neutralized by the RAR antagonist. During HL60 cell differentiation, atRA induced RARbeta mRNA, while the RXR had no effect. Interestingly, a functional RXR-pathway was also seen in lipopolysaccharide-induced inhibition of mouse splenocyte proliferation. These results strongly suggest the existence of a pharmacological RXR-dependent pathway that is activated by a ligand that can bind to RXR.
