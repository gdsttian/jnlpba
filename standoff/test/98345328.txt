The molecular and phenotypic profile of primary central nervous system lymphoma identifies distinct categories of the disease and is consistent with histogenetic derivation from germinal center-related B cells.
Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals. The precise histogenetic derivation and the molecular pathogenesis of PCNSL is poorly understood. In an attempt to clarify the histogenesis and pathogenesis of these lymphomas, 49 PCNSL (26 acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS]-related and 23 AIDS-unrelated) were analyzed for multiple biologic markers, which are known to bear histogenetic and pathogenetic significance for mature B-cell neoplasms. PCNSL associated frequently (50.0%) with mutations of BCL-6 5' noncoding regions, which are regarded as a marker of B-cell transition through the germinal center (GC). Expression of BCL-6 protein, which is restricted to GC B cells throughout physiologic B-cell maturation, was detected in 100% AIDS-unrelated PCNSL and in 56.2% AIDS-related cases. Notably, among AIDS-related PCNSL, expression of BCL-6 was mutually exclusive with expression of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded latent membrane protein (LMP)-1 and, with few exceptions, also of BCL-2. All but one PCNSL expressed hMSH2, which among mature B cells selectively stains GC B cells. These data suggest that PCNSL may be frequently related to GC B cells and may be segregated into two major biologic categories based on the expression pattern of BCL-6, LMP-1, and BCL-2. BCL-6(+)/LMP-1(-)/BCL-2(-) PCNSL occur both in the presence and in the absence of HIV infection and consistently display a large noncleaved cell morphology. Conversely, BCL-6(-)/LMP-1(+)/BCL-2(+) PCNSL are restricted to HIV-infected hosts and are represented by lymphomas with immunoblastic features. These data are relevant for the pathogenesis and histogenesis of PCNSL and may be helpful to segregate distinct biologic and prognostic categories of these lymphomas.
