Functional interaction of the v-Rel and c-Rel oncoproteins with the TATA-binding protein and association with transcription factor IIB.
Rel family proteins regulate the expression of genes linked to kappa B-binding motifs. Little is known, however, of the mechanism by which they enhance transcription. We have investigated the ability of the v-Rel and c-Rel oncoproteins to interact with components of the basal transcription machinery. Here we report that both the acidic transcription activation domain mapping to the unique C terminus of chicken c-Rel and the F9 cell-specific activation region common to both v-Rel and c-Rel interact with the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) in vitro and in vivo. We also demonstrate that TPB interaction with Rel activation regions leads to synergistic activation of transcription of a kappa B-linked reporter gene. Combined with the observation that the mouse c-Rel and human RelA proteins also interact with TBP and TFIIB in vitro, these results suggest that association with basal transcription factors is important for the transcriptional activities of Rel family proteins.
