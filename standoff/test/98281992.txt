Hypoxia down-regulates MCP-1 expression: implications for macrophage distribution in tumors.
Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) is likely to contribute to the macrophage infiltrate in human ovarian carcinomas. Although MCP-1 is predominantly expressed by the tumor parenchyma, macrophages accumulate at highest density in necrotic regions, which are associated with low oxygen tensions. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) can stimulate MCP-1 production and is also present within ovarian carcinomas. We have investigated the effect of hypoxia both on MCP-1 expression in ovarian cancer cell lines and monocyte migration. Hypoxia down-regulated TNF-alpha-induced MCP-1 mRNA and protein production by ovarian cancer cells. The effect was mimicked by cobalt chloride and desferrioxamine, consistent with a specific oxygen-sensing mechanism. Unlike antioxidants, hypoxia did not inhibit nuclear factor KB mobilization. Monocyte migration in response to MCP-1 was also diminished under hypoxic conditions. Down-regulation of MCP-1 expression and the inhibition of monocyte migration are independent effects of hypoxia that may contribute to the distribution of macrophages within ovarian tumors.
