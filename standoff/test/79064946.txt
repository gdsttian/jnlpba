Nuclear glucocorticoid binding in chronic lymphatic leukemia lymphocytes.
A reliable procedure is described for isolating 3H-triamcinolone acetonide (3H-TA) receptor complexes from purified chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL) lymphocyte nuclei, based on the use of carbobenzoxy-L-phenylalanine (CBZ-L-phe) to prevent breakdown of hormone-receptor complexes during extraction of nuclei with 0.6M KCl. Using this method, specific nuclear glucocorticoid binding was demonstrated in 14/14 patients with untreated CLL. No correlation was found between levels of nuclear-associated 3H-TA and peripheral white blood cell count or rosetting ability of circulating lymphocytes.
