Adhesion of immature and mature T cells induces in human thymic epithelial cells (TEC) activation of IL-6 gene trascription factors (NF-kappaB and NF-IL6) and IL-6 gene expression: role of alpha3beta1 and alpha6beta4 integrins.
T cell precursors homed to thymus develop in close contact with stromal cells. Among them, thymic epithelial cells (TEC) are known to exert dominant roles in their survival and functional shaping. Key molecules mediating TEC/thymocytes interactions include cytokines and growth factors secreted by the two cell types and adhesion receptors mediating cell contact. Signaling events triggered in thymocytes by adhesion to epithelial cells have been extensively investigated, whereas little is known on the opposite phenomenon. We have previously investigated this issue in a co-culture system composed of TEC cultures derived from human normal thymus and heterologous thymocytes. We demonstrated that thymocytes adhere to TEC involving beta1 and beta4 integrins and induce the clustering of alpha3beta1 and alpha6beta4 heterodimers at the TEC surface. In addition thymocyte adhesion was followed by activation of NF-kappaB and NF-IL6 gene transcription factors and enhanced IL-6 production. The two latter phenomena were reproduced by the cross-linking of the alpha3, alpha6, beta1 and beta4 integrins, thus implying that the alpha3beta1 and alpha6beta4 heterodimers can signal during thymocyte adhesion. We have extended our previous work investigating in the same experimental setting the inducing activity of non stimulated or activated policlonal or clonal mature T cells as representative of the more mature thymocyte subset. We found that adhesion of unstimulated T cell i) involved beta1, but not beta4 integrin functions at the surface ii) induced the clustering of alpha3beta1, but not alpha2beta1 heterodimers at the TEC surface and iii) up-regulated the nuclear binding activity of NF-kappaB transcription factor and the IL-6 secretion. We propose that alpha3beta1 and alpha6beta4 heterodimers are induced to cluster at the TEC surface recognizing yet unknown cellular ligands differentially expressed during T cell development.
