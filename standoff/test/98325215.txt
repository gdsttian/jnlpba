Differential expression of Nur77 family members in human T-lymphotropic virus type 1-infected cells: transactivation of the TR3/nur77 gene by Tax protein.
We analyzed the differential expression and regulation of three members of the Nur77 transcription factor family by the human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) Tax protein. We have demonstrated that in both HTLV-1-infected cells and Tax-expressing JPX-9 cells, TR3/nur77 is highly expressed, whereas neither NOR-1 nor NOT expression is detectable. Transient transfection analysis further confirmed the Tax transactivation of the TR3/nur77 promoter but not the NOR-1 promoter in different cell types. Furthermore, expression of a luciferase reporter gene driven by the NGFI-B (rat homolog of TR3/Nur77) response element (NBRE) provided evidence that Tax-mediated transactivation resulted in the induction of a functional protein. Cotransfection assays with the TR3/nur77 promoter sequence or the NBRE binding motif together with a series of Tax mutants have shown that Tax-induced TR3/nur77 expression is mediated by CREB/ATF-related transcription factors.
