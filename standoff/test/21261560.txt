Expression of interferon consensus sequence binding protein induces potent immunity against BCR/ABL-induced leukemia.
Mice deficient in the interferon consensus sequence binding protein (ICSBP) develop a disease resembling chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), which in humans is caused by the BCR/ABL oncoprotein. Interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) induces ICSBP expression and is an effective therapy for CML. This study examined whether enforced expression of ICSBP might antagonize BCR/ABL-induced leukemia; results demonstrated that ICSBP-modified cells generated a protective CD8(+) cytotoxic T-cell response against BCR/ABL-transformed BaF3 cells in a murine leukemia model. ICSBP expression represents a novel means of stimulating a host immune response to BCR/ABL(+) leukemia cells and a potential strategy for immunotherapy of CML. (Blood. 2001;97:3491-3497)
