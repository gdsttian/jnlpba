Thermodynamics of steroid binding to the human glucocorticoid receptor.
The thermodynamics of the interaction of glucocorticoids with their receptor were studied in cytosol from human lymphoblastoid cells. The rate and affinity constants of dexamethasone and cortisol between 0 degree and 25 degrees C were calculated by curve-fitting from time-course and equilibrium kinetics. The data were consistent with a simple reversible bimolecular interaction. Arrhenius and Van't Hoff plots were curvilinear for both steroids. At equilibrium, the solution for the equation delta G = delta H - T X delta S (eqn. 1) was (in kJ X mol-1) -47 = 36 - 83 (dexamethasone) and -42 = -9 - 33 (cortisol) at 0 degree C. Enthalpy and entropy changes decreased quasi-linearly with temperature such that, at 25 degrees C, the respective values were -50 = -75 + 25 and -43 = -48 + 5. Thus, for both steroids, the interaction was entropy-driven at low temperature and became entirely enthalpy-driven at 20 degrees C. Thermodynamic values for the transition state were calculated from the rate constants. For the forward reaction, eqn. (1) gave 45 = 84 - 39 (dexamethasone) and 46 = 60 - 14 (cortisol) at 0 degree C, and 44 = 24 + 20 (dexamethasone) and 46 = 28 + 18 (cortisol) at 25 degrees C. These data fit quite well with a two-step model [Ross & Subramanian (1981) Biochemistry 20, 3096-3102] proposed for ligand-protein interactions, which involves a partial immobilization of the reacting species governed by hydrophobic forces, followed by stabilization of the complex by short-range interactions. On the basis of this model, an analysis of the transition-state thermodynamics led to the conclusion that no more than half of the steroid molecular area is engaged in the binding process.
