[1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptors in lymphocytes and T- and B-lymphocyte count in patients with glomerulonephritis].
Content of receptors to hormonal form of vitamin D3, 1.25(OH)2D3, constituted 27.3 fmole/mg of protein in lymphocytes of peripheric blood of children with glomerulonephritis. In the patients concentration of total and ionized form of Ca2+ was decreased down to 2.04 mmole/L and 1.09 mmole/L, respectively, while an increase in parathormone (PTH) by 36% and a distinct decrease in 25(OH)D concentration (lower than 1.25 ng/ml) was found in blood; content of cAMP was also decreased in lymphocytes by 33%. At the same time, total content of T lymphocytes was decreased 1.5-fold in peripheric blood. Treatment with I-hydroxyvitamin D3 (1-1.5 mg daily, within 4 weeks) led to normalization of total and ionized form of Ca2+ and of 25(OH)D, but did not affect the PTH content in blood. Concentration of the receptors to 1.25(OH)2D3 was elevated up to 39.7 fmole/mg after I week of the treatment, whereas it was decreased to the initial level 24.8 fmole/mg within 4 weeks; simultaneous alteration in the cAMP content was observed in lymphocytes. Treatment with 1-(OH)D3 normalized also the T lymphocytes content in peripheric blood. The data obtained suggest that under conditions of glomerulonephritis only high content of receptors to 1.25(OH)2D3 in lymphocytes enabled to perform the cell response to the hormone effect.
