Mutation of BCL-6 gene in normal B cells by the process of somatic hypermutation of Ig genes.
Immunoglobulin (Ig) genes are hypermutated in B lymphocytes that are the precursors to memory B cells. The mutations are linked to transcription initiation, but non-Ig promoters are permissible for the mutation process; thus, other genes expressed in mutating B cells may also be subject to somatic hypermutation. Significant mutations were not observed in c-MYC, S14, or alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) genes, but BCL-6 was highly mutated in a large proportion of memory B cells of normal individuals. The mutation pattern was similar to that of Ig genes.
